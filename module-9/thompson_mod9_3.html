        <p>
			Kaffee: Upon hearing the news that he was 
			finally getting his transfer, Santiago 
			was so excited, that do you know how 
			many people he called? Zero. Nobody. 
			Not one call to his parents saying 
			he was coming home. Not one call to 
			a friend saying can you pick me up 
			at the airport. He was asleep in his 
			bed at midnight, and according to 
			you he was getting on a plane in six 
			hours, yet everything he owned was 
			hanging neatly in his closet and 
			folded neatly in his <span id="footlocker">_________</span>. You 
			were leaving for one day and you 
			packed a bag and made three phone 
			calls. Santiago was leaving for the 
			rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
			a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
			Can you explain that? The fact is 
			there was no transfer order. Santiago 
			wasn't going anywhere, isn't that 
			right, Colonel.
        </p>

			Ross: Object. Your Honor, it's obvious 
			that Lt. Kaffee's intention this 
			morning is to smear a high ranking 
			marine officer in the desperate hope 
			that the mere appearance of 
			impropriety will win him points with 
			the jury. It's my <span id="recommendation">______________</span>, 
			sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an 
			official reprimand from the bench, 
			and that the witness be excused with 
			the Court's deepest apologies.
		</p> 
		<p>
			Jessep: Absolutely. My answer is I don't 
			have the first damn clue. Maybe he 
			was an early morning riser and he 
			liked to pack in the nq. And maybe 
			he didn't have any friends. I'm an 
			<span id="educated">________</span> man, but I'm afraid I can't 
			speak intelligently about the travel 
			habits of William Santiago.  What I 
			do know is that he was set to leave 
			the base at 0600. Now are these really 
			the questions I was called here to 
			answer? Phone calls and footlockers? 
			Please tell me you've got something 
			more, Lieutenant. Please tell me 
			there's an <span id="ace">___</span> up your sleeve. These 
			two marines are on trial for their 
			lives. Please tell me their lawyer 
			hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
			bill.
